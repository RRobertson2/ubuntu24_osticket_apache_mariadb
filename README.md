# LAMP Stack Deployment with osTicket Helpdesk System

### Objective
Deploy and configure osTicket on a Linux virtual machine using the LAMP stack (Linux, Apache, MariaDB, PHP). This project included end-to-end setup of the web server, database, PHP extensions, SSL certificates, firewall rules, and application hardening to deliver a secure and functional ticketing system.


### Skills Learned
- Installing and configuring the LAMP stack on Ubuntu Server
- Setting up and securing OpenSSH for remote server management
- Creating and managing MariaDB databases and user accounts
- Deploying web applications (osTicket) to Apache webroot
- Configuring SSL/TLS certificates and Apache virtual hosts
- Managing Linux file permissions and directory ownership
- Implementing firewall rules for SSH and HTTPS access
- Post-installation hardening of a production web application<br>
  <br>
### Tools Used
- Ubuntu Server 24.04 LTS – Operating system for deployment
- Apache2 – Web server for hosting osTicket
- MariaDB – Relational database for ticketing data
- PHP + Extensions – Application runtime and dependencies
- OpenSSH – Secure shell access for remote management
- UFW (Uncomplicated Firewall) – Firewall rule management
- OpenSSL – SSL/TLS certificate generation
- osTicket v1.18.2 – Open-source ticketing system application

### Step 1: Check Network Interface

Verify the IP address assigned to your Linux VM. This ensures the server is reachable on your network before proceeding with package installations and remote configurations.<br>
<br>
- Run ip addr show to display network interfaces and assigned IP addresses.
- Confirm the server has an active network connection.
- Identify the IP (e.g., 192.168.1.161) for use in SSH and web access.<br>

### Step 2: Install and Configure SSH

Secure Shell (SSH) allows remote access to the Linux server. We install, configure, and validate SSH service to ensure administrators can manage the server remotely.<br>
<br>
- Install OpenSSH server with sudo apt install openssh-server -y.
- Provides secure remote login for system administration.
- Start and enable SSH, configure authentication options, and test connectivity.<br>

### Step 3: Add the Custom Domain
Click Add Custom Domain. A panel will appear on the right side of the screen. Enter your purchased domain name (from GoDaddy) and select Add Domain.<br>
<br>
- Registers your owned domain with Azure.
- Creates a verification process for domain ownership.
- Prepares for DNS record configuration.<br>

<br>

### Step 4: Retrieve TXT Record Information
Azure will prompt you to create a TXT record in your DNS provider’s settings. Copy the following details:

- Alias or Host Name
- Destination / Points To Address
- TTL (Time to Live)
<br>
- TXT records verify ownership of the domain.<br>
- Ensures secure integration between Azure and the DNS provider.<br>
- Prevents domain spoofing by confirming legitimate control.<br>

### Step 5: Access GoDaddy DNS Management
Sign in to your GoDaddy account. Navigate to your domain, select the DNS tab, and open DNS Records. Choose Add New Record.<br>
<br>
- Accessing DNS records is necessary to insert Azure’s TXT verification record.
- Ensures updates are made at the authoritative DNS provider.
- Initiates the verification process for Azure.<br>

<hr style="border: 0.15px solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.05);">

### Step 6: Add TXT Record in GoDaddy
In the Add New Record pop-up:

- Type: TXT Record
- Name: @
- Value: MS=ms35983121
- TTL: Custom, set to 3600<br>
Click Save.<br>
<br>
- @ points to the root domain.
- MS=... value is generated by Azure for verification.
- TTL sets how quickly the change propagates.<br>

<hr style="border: 0.15px solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.05);">

### Step 7: Verify the Domain in Azure

Return to Azure Custom Domain Names and click Verify for the domain. On the right-hand verification panel, you should see Domain Name is Verified.<br>
<br>
- Confirms DNS changes have propagated successfully.
- Officially links the domain to your Azure tenant.
- Allows the domain to be used for sign-ins and email.<br>
<br>

<hr style="border: 0.15px solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.05);">

### Step 8: Set as Primary Domain

From Azure Custom Domain Names, confirm the status shows Verified for your domain (farmhouzdesign.com). Click the domain link and set it as Primary.<br>
<br>
- Ensures all new users default to the branded domain.
- Creates a consistent user identity across Microsoft 365 services.
- Improves professional appearance for all communications.<br>

<br>
Review the configuration details, ensuring the correct domain is selected. Finalize by clicking Create.<br>

### Step 9: Verify Domain Assignment on Users

Go to Users in Microsoft Entra ID, select a newly created user, and confirm their sign-in address uses the custom domain.<br>
<br>
- Verifies that the domain change has been applied to user accounts.
- Confirms readiness for production email and login use.
- Demonstrates successful domain branding in a live environment.<br>
